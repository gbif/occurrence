# GBIF Public Datasets on Google Cloud

This describes the format and gives simple examples for getting started with the GBIF monthly snapshots stored on Google Cloud.

## BigQuery

The latest snapshot is available as a public dataset in Google BigQuery.  See the [BigQuery description](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/gbif-occurrences).

The snapshot includes all CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-NC licensed occurrence data published through GBIF.

## Cloud Storage

Periodic snapshots since April 2021 are stored as public data in GCS in the bucket `public-datasets-gbif`.

Within the bucket, the periodic occurrence snapshots are stored in `occurrence/YYYY-MM-DD`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` corresponds to the date of the snapshot.  Data are stored in Parquet format, described below.

The snapshot includes all CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-NC licensed occurrence data published through GBIF.

Each snapshot contains a `citation.txt` with instructions on how best to cite the data, and the data files themselves in Parquet format: `occurrence.parquet/*`.

Therefore, the data files for the first snapshot are at

`gs://public-datasets-gbif/occurrence/2021-04-13/occurrence.parquet/*`

and the citation information is at

`gs://public-datasets-gbif/occurrence/2021-04-13/citation.txt`

## Schema

The Parquet file schema is described here.

Most field names correspond to [terms from the Darwin Core standard](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/), and have been interpreted by GBIF's systems to align taxonomy, location, dates etc.
Additional information may be retrived using the [GBIF API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary).

¹ Field names are lower case, but in later snapshots this may change to camelCase, for consistency with Darwin Core and the GBIF API.

² Either `occurrenceID`, or `institutionCode` + `collectionCode` + `catalogNumber`, or both, will be present on every record.

³ The array may be empty.

### Change history

Snapshots from 2021-04-13 included only CC0 and CC-BY data.

From 2022-04-01, snapshots include all data (CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC).  Filter using the `license` column if you need to exclude CC-BY-NC data.

From 2022-05-01, the timestamp fields `eventDate`, `dateIdentified` and `lastIntepreted` have a timestamp type, rather than the previous string type.  The fields `identifiedby`, `recordedby` and `typestatus` are changed from a string type to a string array.

From 2023-02-01, the `gbifid` field has string type, for compatibility with other biodiversity data aggregators.

From 2025-08-01, the fields `taxonkey` and `specieskey` have string type, in preparation for a future change to Catalogue of Life’s taxonomy.

## Getting started with BigQuery

BigQuery provides a pay-per-query SQL service on Google Cloud, particularly well suited for producing summary counts from GBIF data.
The following steps describe how to get started using BigQuery on the GBIF dataset.

1. Open the [GBIF Occurrences dataset in BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2sgbif!3soccurrences)
2. Run a query, by pasting the following command in the editor window

```sql
SELECT kingdom, count(*) AS c
FROM `bigquery-public-data.gbif.occurrences`
GROUP BY kingdom;
```

Results (your numbers will differ since the data is updated every month):

|   | kingdom        | c          |
|---|----------------|------------|
| 1 | Plantae        | 193391585  |
| 2 | incertae sedis | 4223619    |
| 3 | Archaea        | 226905     |
| 4 | Fungi          | 12210273   |
| 5 | Viruses        | 42019      |
| 6 | Bacteria       | 13313089   |
| 7 | Animalia       | 1064194305 |
| 8 | Protozoa       | 793176     |
| 9 | Chromista      | 9440667    |

3. Your results should show in the browser, and can also be saved in Google Drive, as CSV, as a new BigQuery table etc.
4. The amount of data scanned will be shown under "Execution Details", which is used to calculate the billing.

## Using an older snapshot with BigQuery

The public table contains the latest data from GBIF.  You can create private tables from older snapshots if you need to.

Create a new BigQuery data set, and create a table within that data set.  Import from `public-datasets-gbif/occurrence/2022-05-01/occurrence.parquet/*`, changing the date as required.

## Downloading/mirroring the data

A monthly snapshot is roughly 180GB in size.

The GCS buckets are public, and can be accessed anonymously using the [GCS APIs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/apis), [gsutil CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil), or tools like [rclone](https://rclone.org).

```
# gcloud CLI
gsutil ls gs://public-datasets-gbif/occurrence/

# rclone configuration
[gcs]
type = google cloud storage
project_number = [set by you]
service_account_file = [set by you]

# rclone commands
rclone ls gcs:public-datasets-gbif
rclone sync -v gcs:public-datasets-gbif/occurrence/2021-04-13/ ./gbif_2021-04-13/
```
