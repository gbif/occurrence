# If the coordinates are in XX, but the provider says YY, then we change the country to XX and
# (usually) add an issue.  Or, the other way around.
#
# If GBIF's usage of the ISO code / country varies from the standard, we don't add the issue.
# At present, this is only done for Western Sahara.
# This change is also done for occurrences without co-ordinates.
#
# If the ISO standard includes regions at more than one level, in some cases we don't add the issue.
# At present, this is done for the French overseas departments (GP=FR-GP, etc) and Kosovo (XK=RS-KM).

# Record counts are approximate, from January 2016.
