## Motivation
GBIF has been providing gbif data snapshots based on selected criteria for downloads in different format SIMPLE CSV, DWCA and  AVRO. However it has been observed that they are of limited use to various gbif users as they need to re-process these download for analytical relevance or textual brevity. Performing these operations is quite cumbersome on MS Excel at the user end, and when the downloads are big it is very difficult due to lack of access to computation resources and softwares. 

## Introduction
SQL queries are one of the most popular ways to query the data. It enables various functions or transformations to access the fields or data as user desires. SQL Download API will help gbif users to download the gbif occurrence data as a simple plain SQL query.  This feature helps the advanced users to get the relevant data in simple CSV format carrying out textual transformations and analytical processing on gbif infrastructure. 

## Feature
The SQL download is supported by 3 different types of services: 
1. _SQL Describe service_: This service describe all the queryable fields, there types and description. 
2. _SQL Validation service_: Validate the SQL query before executing the query for download. This helps user to create a proper SQL query before performing download on gbif infrastructure. 
3. _SQL Download service_: This service helps to create the SQL download at gbif infrastructure and returns the downloadkey which can be used to see the progress of gbif downloads.

### Rules for SQL query

SQL query supported by GBIF API need to follow some rules, they are :
1. Sql query supported format: <br/>
   SELECT `<field1>`,`<field2>`,`<field3>`,`<field4>` FROM occurrence WHERE `<condition1>` AND `<condition2>` OR `<condition3>` …  GROUP BY … .
2. All the identifier in query should be quoted by \` (back quotes). It is not hard requirement but there are conflicts with SQL keywords and DWCA fields. So it is important that these fields are back quoted to be parsed correctly. The reserved keywords for SQL are mentioned [here](#sql-keywords).  
3. ORDER BY, DML queries, SET queries (UNION, INTERSECT), Subqueries (AS), JOINS not allowed.
4. Table name should always be “occurrence”.	
5. ‘*’ can’t be used, provide fields for selection explicitly.
6. HAVING clause not supported.

**Note**:
For example : A query using month and year for Downloads will not work as MONTH and YEAR are keywords in SQL and fields in GBIF schema. 
  ~~``` SELECT gbifid, countrycode, datasetkey, license, month, year FROM occurrence WHERE month=3 AND year = 2018 ```~~ to   quote month and year will solve the problem 
  ```SELECT gbifid, countrycode, datasetkey, license, `month`, `year` FROM occurrence WHERE `month`=3 AND `year`= 2018```.

### SQL Functions supported

[SQL Download API supports all built in functions of hive 1.1. Please refer](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF#LanguageManualUDF-Built-inFunctions)

### Citation and Licenses for Downloads

License for the query which produces new data from old ones, i.e those which has functions and aggregations from entire datasets in gbif are licensed as CC by 4.0 and cites gbif. All other queries has restrictive download license based on the datasets used, and cites them as usual.

## Getting started

Prerequisite :
1. gbif-account
2. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)
3. Web browser 

**Step 1.** Describe all gbif fields to know the fields to query <br/>

```
curl -X GET \
  https://api.gbif-uat.org/v1/occurrence/download/request/sql/describe \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
```

**Step 2.** Select the required fields from the Step 1 and form a desired sql query <br/>
For example, we want to know the count of species available in 10*10 square grid of the world map.

```
SELECT 
  decimallatitude/10 AS lat, 
  decimallongitude/10 AS lon, 
  count(species) AS speciesRichness 
FROM occurrence 
GROUP BY 
  decimallatitude/10, 
  decimallongitude/10
```
Validate the query with SQL validation service

```
curl -G -i https://api.gbif-uat.org/v1/occurrence/download/request/sql/validate --data-urlencode \
"sql=SELECT 
  DISTINCT(countrycode) 
FROM occurrence
WHERE
taxonKey=6"
```

You get a json response, and check for -> "issues": []. If you have issues they will be highlighted and described here.

**Step 3.** When the query is finalised, Create a download request using following steps
Note: Provide your username, password, valid notification address and user name in creator field before using the command below.

```
curl -X POST   http://api.gbif-uat.org/v1/occurrence/download/request/sql   --user <username>:<password>   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   -H 'cache-control: no-cache'   -d '{
  "creator": "<user>",
  "notification_address": [
    "user@lab.edu"
  ],
  "send_notification": "true",
  "format": "SQL",
  "sql": "SELECT decimallatitude/10 lat, decimallongitude/10 lon, count(species) AS speciesRichness 
  FROM occurrence GROUP BY decimallatitude/10, decimallongitude/10"
}
 '
```

you get download key which can be tracked online for downloads or turn on notification by making send_notification: true and adding your email id in notification_address field of above curl statement.

For example to track the download for downloadkey= 0000015-181121175518854, open the web browser in your computer and navigate to <br/>
[https://www.gbif-uat.org/occurrence/download/0000015-181121175518854](https://www.gbif-dev.org/occurrence/download/0000015-181121175518854)

## Future Works

1. Removing back quotes(`) from identifiers.
2. Supporting HAVING clause

## Open Questions

## Conclusion
SQL Download API help creating, transforming and downloading GBIF occurrence data as SQL queries.
