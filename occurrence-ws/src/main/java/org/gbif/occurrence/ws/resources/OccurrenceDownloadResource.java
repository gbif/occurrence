    "*The documentation here is automatically generated from the Java code.  It is always up-to-date, but the structure for the main " +
    "download request method is complex.*\n\n" +
    "This API provides services to request bulk downloads of occurrence records and retrieve " +
    "information about those downloads.\n\n" +
    "Occurrence downloads are created asynchronously — the user requests a download and, once complete, is sent an " +
    "email with a link to the resulting file.\n\n" +
    "It is necessary to register as a user at [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/) to create a download request, " +
    "and use HTTP authentication using the username (not the email) and password.\n\n" +
    "### Occurrence Download Predicates\n\n" +
    "For the API reference for download predicates expand the “Schema” → `predicate` section of the request body schema on the " +
    "[creation API call](#Occurrence%20downloads/requestDownload) (the first one after this text).\n\n" +
    "### Occurrence Download Limits\n\n" +
    "Occurrence downloads demand significant computational resources, and are monitored and limited according to the " +
    "GBIF platform load. In order to avoid that downloads requested by a single user utilize most of the resources " +
    "two rules have been set:\n\n" +
    "1. Download complexity limits:\n" +
    "   * A download predicate may contain a maximum of 101,000 items (taxon keys, kingdom keys, phylum keys, " +
    "     catalogue numbers, occurrence ids and so on).\n" +
    "   * A download predicate may contain a maximum of 10,000 points in any “within” predicate geometries.\n" +
    "2. Limits on incomplete (preparing, running) downloads:\n" +
    "   * If the total number of incomplete downloads is fewer than 100, any single user can have no more than 3 " +
    "     incomplete downloads.\n" +
    "   * If the total number of downloads is fewer than 1000 any single user may only have 1 download.\n\n" +
    "The number of user downloads currently in progress can be seen on the " +
    "[System Health page](https://www.gbif.org/system-health). Your own downloads can be seen on your " +
    "[My Downloads](https://www.gbif.org/user/download) page.",
